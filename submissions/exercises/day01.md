### Instructions ˚₊‧꒰ა ☆ ໒꒱ ‧₊˚

Visit both Shopee and Lazada's web and mobile applications. Explore their homepages, analyze interface designs, and document your experiences.<br/>

#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1 🚀✨<br/>

**꒰ ♡ ꒱ User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

☁︎   **Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?**<br/>
    **Answer:** As a frequent user of both applications, I find that finding products is easier with Shopee because it displays more relevant products than Lazada. The search and recommendation algorithms on Lazada may not be as great as Shopee's. Lazada makes it more difficult to find a specific product.

☁︎   **Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.**<br/>
    **Answer:** Personally, I believe Shopee's Shopee Video feature is unnecessary, especially when there are better apps with similar functions available, such as Tiktok. As a result, only a small number of users are utilizing this feature. Users who already have well-established alternatives that provide a more seamless and enjoyable experience may perceive Shopee's entry into this space as unnecessary.

☁︎   **Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platforms’   content is easier to scan and understand?**<br/>
    **Answer:** Shopee's organization is far better than Lazada's because the latter appears more cluttered. Especially with how they show the products, Shopee's looks a lot more organized and clean, while Lazada's presentation of products lacks uniformity, making it harder to scan and navigate. The cluttered look of Lazada provides a less user-friendly environment compared to Shopee.

<br/>**꒰ ♡ ꒱ User-Interface Analysis:**

☁︎   **Is the websites’ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?**<br/>
    **Answer:** Both are true to their respective brands. Personally, I believe that Shopee's layout and design are more visually appealing; it appears clean in the eyes, which makes users—such as myself—feel at ease when navigating their website. Lazada, on the other hand, has room to improve its design. I believe the elements take up a lot of space, making it appear cluttered and overwhelming.
    
☁︎   **Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.**<br/>
    **Answer:** Both applications demonstrate responsiveness because they can adapt to the device in use, responding to the user's behavior and environment based on screen size, platform, and orientation. They can be used on a mobile phone or on a computer, no matter what their size is.
    
☁︎   **Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?**<br/>
    **Answer:** I prefer Shopee's visual over Lazada's, particularly their colors; I believe Shopee's choice of orange as their primary color makes the website more appealing to users, which is the opposite for Lazada. As I previously stated, Shopee also did a better job of designing their interface because it is very clean, and you will feel at ease using it because it is not overwhelming. This is an area where I believe Lazada can improve.

☁︎ I think the game is really fun in itself; it's quite challenging, and I believe it can help a web designer's eye in pinning down even the smallest details. Personally, adding music or other features will almost certainly make it more engaging.
